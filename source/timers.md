title: Timers App
comments: false

---

With the **Timers** app for Kitchen Essentials you can time five things. Use a timer for things other than cooking. If the kids are misbehaving, put them in a timeout and have **Timers** count down. Is there a 15-minute reading assignment after school? Track it here! Does the steak need to rest for 5-minutes? Set up a timer!
